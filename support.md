## Ercole consulting services

### Oracle database licensing optimization assessment

On the overall database analysis , following areas are evaluated :

* LICENSING
We will look for an overall view of Oracle RDBMS licenses and options used , unused and due on the actual architecture. 
* RUN / GOVERNANCE
We will look for  what configurations have impacts of database RUN (day by day activities)
The target is to locate any issues that could worse RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
* CAPACITY
We will analyze parameters that helps us to understand if actual infrastructure is correctly sized to best support the database workload , highlighting any gap and allocation excesses.
* PERFORMANCE
In this area the attention is oriented to actual database performance highlighting any gap and allocation excesses.

We will create and share a detailed document with all the critical issues and optimization with a gap resolution proposal.
